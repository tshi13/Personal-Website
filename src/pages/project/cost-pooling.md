  College is expensive but life doesn't have to be. Split.it is a web app that makes costpooling easy and reduces our carbon footprint.

I’m currently part of a student startup at Johns Hopkins University called Split.it, working as a Full Stack Developer. We’ve built a platform that allows users who use ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft to find other people to share the car and split the cost, while reducing carbon emissions to the environment. 

I worked on the frontend that allows users to customize date, time, pickup location, destination, ride capacity, and notes when creating a new ride-sharing event or joining existing events using React. I also created and integrated frontend and backend for reporting users for bad behavior using MongoDB, Express.js.

To ensure safety, this platform is only open to JHU students temporarily. We have 15+ rides to the airport lined up for winter break already!
