  Stop procrastinating. Let your friends help and hold you accountable for the most important things.

I'm currently leading a team of 6 to work on a task completion producitivity application called Do It. I focused on building Mongoose Schemas and developed all backend RESTful APIs that handle creating and modifying accounts, groups, and tasks as well as fetching relevant data from our MongoDB database. I also designed our landing page and integrated Google + Facebook login authentication as well as GetStream chat API

The purpose of DoIt is to help you stay focused and motivated on the important things in life. The market lacks a solution that focuses on actually pushing users to actually do the tasks! We discovered people are motivated more by losses than by gains, so we want to motivate people by introducing consequences of having DoIt coins on the line. 

Whenever you want to stay focused or show off your accomplishments to your circle of friends, use DoIt and place a bet of DoIt coins. Stay motivated daily and turn hard work into a handful of DoIt coins. In the future, we believe that DoIt would be a popular productivity app that helps people beat their laziness and reach their goals with others in an interesting and pleasant way.


* Users can set private tasks for themselves or set tasks for everyone in a group. 
* For group tasks, other people can keep track of them by verifying their posts in the group chat. The user who fails to do their tasks will lose DoIt coins and the rest of the users will spilt the coins evenly. Successful users will be able to help friends gain better habits, get tasks done, earn more DoIt coins along the way, and have the opportunity to upload content to group chats to communicate with friends.
